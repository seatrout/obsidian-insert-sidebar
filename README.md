# Insert Sidenotes

This is a a tiny plugin that solves a problem for people who use @mjmeyers' [typography plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography) for Obsidian alongside the elegant css sidenotes found [here](https://github.com/Dmitriy-Shulha/obsidian-css-snippets) and in @ceciliamay's [Primary theme](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary).

All it does is to supply two commands to make selected text into a sidenote, either open or closed (hidden). These can be bound to the hotkeys of your choice. It's needed because otherwise the styling tag gets its double quotes turned into smart quotes by the typography plugin, which breaks the css.
